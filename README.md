# Description
This is the draft for an Anki add-on to track Anki progress in Beeminder. It is based on the Anki 2.0 add-on beetime ([add-on](), [Beeminder forum](http://forum.beeminder.com/t/announcing-beeminder-for-anki/2206)[repo](https://github.com/ianmcb/beetime)) by [ianmcb](https://github.com/ianmcb). 

It supports syncing time spent reviewing, number of cards reviewed and/or number of cards/notes added, with more metrics planned.
